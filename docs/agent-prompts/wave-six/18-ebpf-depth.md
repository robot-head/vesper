# eBPF: more program types, tail calls, BTF CO-RE and verifier precision

Suggested branch: `wave6/ebpf-depth`. Claim issue: #260.

~~~text
You are implementing one substantial milestone of the Vesper design (§27) in https://github.com/robot-head/vesper.

Start from a fresh origin/main in a NEW cloud checkout or dedicated git worktree. Require baseline cda092f2f6427e23c566d7e63259000d3d6c699f or a descendant; record the actual SHA. Development happens on `main`; open your PR against `main`. Read AGENTS.md if present, docs/parallel-work.md, docs/implementation.md, docs/bazel.md, docs/rfcs/wave-six-contracts.md, docs/agent-prompts/wave-six/README.md, the earlier report(s) for your area under docs/parallel-results/, and the whole of §27 in docs/specification.txt (the snapshot matches the Google Doc revision modified 2026-11-13 04:46 UTC) before editing.

Claim: this work is claimed by GitHub issue #260. Before you start, check the open issues and PRs in robot-head/vesper for overlapping work by other agents; if something overlaps, stop and report instead of duplicating it. Link #260 from your PR ("Closes #260").

Delivery and coordination:
- Deliver working code and meaningful acceptance tests, not only a proposal or scaffold. Finish the supported slice; reject unsupported cases explicitly with typed errors. If an item turns out to be infeasible, deliver the rest and explain why in the report.
- Edit only the exclusive paths below. Other wave-six lanes run concurrently; never edit their paths and never depend on an unmerged lane's work. Library crates must not depend on the root `vesper` package.
- Other agents (Codex) hold §42 rewrite-witness and optimizer work (issues #230-#242, PR #238: src/optimize*, the rewrite tests and their Lean files). Do not edit those paths. Do not write the eBPF linear ringbuf/socket builder API (PR #165, excluded by the owner).
- Root patch rule (user-approved 2026-11-12): you MAY commit your own minimal root patch onto YOUR PR branch so CI goes green: new `[workspace.dependencies]` entries and the regenerated Cargo.lock, and, for a new crate, registration in root Cargo.toml `members` AND `default-members` (insert before "experiments/native-pulse") plus its BUILD.bazel from `python3 tools/bazel/sync_build_files.py`. Keep it in its own commit. Root Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock conflict often: merge origin/main into your branch right before merging, regenerate the lockfile with cargo rather than hand-merging it, and wait for CI on the merged head.
- Bazel: Linux CI runs `bazel test //...` on BuildBuddy. Files a test reads from outside its crate directory must be declared in that crate's BUILD.bazel (`extra_compile_data`, `extra_test_data`); Lean-model tests need `extra_test_data = ["//:lean"]` and usually `copy_test_cwd` (see crates/vesper-chrono/BUILD.bazel). Windows CI uses Cargo.
- `vesper fmt --check` runs in CI on every tracked .ves file; new .ves fixtures must be canonically formatted unless listed with a reason in scripts/fmt-exclude.txt.
- Prefer mature, widely used crates for cryptography, parsing and kernel/hardware access; pin exact compatible versions; never vendor or hand-roll cryptographic primitives. Reuse versions already in Cargo.lock where possible (Cranelift 0.125, Wasmtime 50, rustls 0.23, arrow 56).
- Use an isolated target directory per checkout. Use CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2, CARGO_PROFILE_DEV_DEBUG=0, CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0 and CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 where space is limited.
- Shared core ExprKind, Type and Place-IR Op/Terminator schemas, arithmetic semantics (vesper.arith.checked/1), interface semantics v2 and native/fiber ABI v2 are frozen unless your assignment says otherwise. Preserve k_i ⊑ m_i and the existing abort/loan/one-shot checks.
- Unsafe code is forbidden except where your assignment allows it: The existing gated `bpf()` module only.
- Linear obligations in host libraries are non-Clone, non-Copy, #[must_use] owners whose only exits are documented consuming calls; a dropped owner is detected (debug panic or counted leak), never silently released. Rust ownership is not evidence that the Vesper source typing rules are implemented; say so in your report.
- Malformed, ambiguous, overflowed and over-budget inputs are typed errors, never success, and never panics on untrusted bytes.
- "0 Alloc" claims require a counting global allocator test over the warmed-up steady state. Hardware and kernel features must be reported as unavailable unless actually exercised (the cloud host has no /dev/kvm, no PKU, no Intel PT and no hardware PMU; perf_event_paranoid is 2). A software model validates the modelled protocol only. Report only performance you measured, with the setup.
- Lean: files must compile with the pinned Lean 4.24.0 (elan downloads are blocked in the cloud; use the GitHub release tarball), contain no `sorry`/`admit`/new axioms, and be checked from your crate's tests when `VESPER_LEAN` is set (follow crates/vesper-simd/tests/model.rs). State exactly what is proved about which model, and that it is not a theorem about the Rust code.
- Do not start overlapping subagents, edit the Google Doc, publish packages, or message third parties.
- Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, focused tests, `cargo test --workspace --locked` and strict `cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Record exact commands and results.
- Commit and push YOUR branch only. Open a ready-for-review PR against main that closes #260. The user has authorized merging this effort's PRs once all required CI checks (`check`, `macOS (AArch64)`, `Windows (x86_64 MSVC)`) are green and review comments are addressed. Return base/commit/PR, public API, checks, root patch, decisions and remaining gaps. Your report path below is mandatory.

Assignment: eBPF: more program types, tail calls, BTF CO-RE and verifier precision (§27).

Exclusive ownership:
- crates/vesper-ebpf/** (except any linear builder module)
- lean/EbpfFirewall.lean
- docs/parallel-results/ebpf-depth.md
Existing dependencies.

Implement:
1. Program types tc (sched_cls), tracepoint and kprobe in the verifier and ELF emitter, with their context layouts and helper sets.
2. Tail calls (prog arrays), `bpf_loop`, and kfunc calls with BTF ids.
3. BTF CO-RE relocations and `.BTF.ext` (func info, line info, CO-RE relocs) in emitted objects, checked by `aya-obj` and by the kernel.
4. Verifier precision tracking and scalar id linking, reducing the "kernel only" column of the random-program differential without introducing unsound acceptances.
5. Do NOT write the linear `BpfRingSlot`/`BpfSocketRef` builder API (prompt item 3 of wave five): an automated safety filter stopped two threads on it and the owner excluded it.

Acceptance:
- The kernel differential (accepted-by-us implies accepted-by-kernel) over the new program types on the cloud host, plus ELF parse tests.
- Report: docs/parallel-results/ebpf-depth.md, with what was built, checks, decisions and remaining gaps.
